SilenceTimer
===========

This app detects when you set your ringer to silent or vibration mode will help you turn your ringer volume on again. 

- The timer for restoring the volume is set either automatically from a default or via setting a timer in a notification. 
- The timer can easily be adjusted from the notification if you need your phone to stay quiet for a little while longer.

I created this app mostly for myself since I wanted the functionality, but couldn't find any app that did this and only this.
